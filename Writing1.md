## Problem:

Project Part I: Definition

You are an employee of Cereals Incorporated, a large manufacturer of breakfast food products.  Your supervisor, Madison County, approaches you because she knows you recently took a course on gamification, which she has heard will revolutionize marketing. 

She tells you that Cereals Inc. is about to release a new line of ready-to-eat breakfast pastries, and she wants to know whether to use gamification as part of the marketing strategy.  The breakfast pastries will be aimed at the 18-35 age bracket. Surveys show members of this demographic often skip breakfast because they don’t want to eat the typical cereals of their youth, and they are too active to cook their own breakfasts.  Market research indicates that the pastries are likely to appeal more to women than men by a 65%-35% ratio. Cereals Inc. has a 35% share of the overall breakfast food market, but only a 10% share of the fragmented ready-to-eat segment.  

Provide as many reasons as you can why gamification could be a useful technique to apply to the situation your manager has presented to you.  Explain why these reasons address the specific scenario provided.  At this stage, focus on the problem rather than the solution.  In other words, describe the goals of the project, not the particular game elements or other techniques you plan to use.  We strongly encourage you to watch this week's lecture segments before attempting this assignment.
 

Format: Maximum of 300 words.  A normal answer will be 1-2 paragraphs of text, and/or a set of bullet points.  Your submission should be self-contained (not requiring the grader to view any outside materials) and should provide sufficient details for the grader to understand the basis for your statements.  

Please remember that you have agreed to the Coursera Honor Code as part of your enrollment for this course.  Your submission must be your own work, and not copied from another student or an online resource such as Wikipedia.  Graders will be instructed to assign a score of “0” to plagiarized work.



## My Anwser:

gamification can motivate human ‘s behavior providing more fun in doing things like eating breakfast ,in the scenario given above,people in the age 18-35 are too active(busy) to cook their breakfast ,that’s the lack of motivation. In the video of week2 and video of http://www.thefuntheory.com/ people are encouraged to do thing because of fun. Using the gamification technique can greatly motivate people.

The market research shows that Cereal Inc. have only 10% amount of market share in fragmented ready to eat pastries compared to 35% market share in overall breakfast market. Gamification can change people’s emotion and motivation so using gamification can greatly increase the market share (like the Nike+ mentioned on the course).

Women are emotional animal ,they are more impulse buying in women than men. Beside that women are social animal ,they like to gather together to gossip and share things. One of the gamification element is social element . Because most part of the people who eat pastries are women. So I think using the gamification technique will greatly improve the market share especially for women market.

In tradition marketing people see the ads and go to buy your product (passively receiving information) but in a gamified marketing system people actively participate. With the active participation and the power of social network.It will create more market using same amount of money. (Compared to traditional Advertisement)
