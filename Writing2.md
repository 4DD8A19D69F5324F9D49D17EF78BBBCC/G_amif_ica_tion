## Problem

Project Part II: Motivation

You are approached by Ryan Morrison, the mayor of a medium-sized city in the Midwest of the United States.  He has heard that you know a lot about gamification and believes that gamification techniques can transform city government.  

He would like to start with the health of city employees.  The city has 50,000 employees and they happen to have exactly the same rates of obesity as the U.S. average: 34.4% overweight (but not obese) and 33.9% of them are obese.  53.1% of the city’s employees do not meet the U.S. Physical Activity Guidelines for aerobic physical activity and 76% of them fail to meet the Guidelines for muscle-strengthening activity.  The city pays for health benefits for its employees and this cost is a huge part of the city budget.  Economists in Mayor Morrison’s office have estimated that a 3% improvement in the average physical fitness of city employees would amount to a US$94 million reduction in annual city health costs; a 5% improvement would save US$188 million.  

Describe in general terms a gamified system that could effectively motivate behavior change to address the challenge presented above. Specifically, explain how the system would effectively incorporate intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, or both. Your answer should address the fact that this is an internal gamification project, targeted at the institutional goals of the city government.  The system can use any technology (or no technology!), so long as the resources required seem justified by the scope of the opportunity. 
 

Format: Maximum of 500 words.  A normal answer will be 2-3 paragraphs of text, and/or a set of bullet points.  Your submission should be self-contained (not requiring the grader to view any outside materials) and should provide sufficient details for the grader to understand the basis for your statements.

Please remember that you have agreed to the Coursera Honor Code as part of your enrollment for this course.  Your submission must be your own work, and not copied from another student or an online resource such as Wikipedia.  Graders will be instructed to assign a score of “0” to plagiarized work.  


## My Anwser

#1. Problem analysis
To solve the problem of obesity problem descrbed above . we should find the root cause of the problem. first, city employees are busy they have no time to do the exercise. second city employees do not have enough motivation to do exercises they perfer to stay at home sitting in front of computer all days, third when people are overweight , they know the consequences and they REALLY want to lose weight, they make plans to lose weight, but the plans are hard to continue (lack of intrinsic motivation) and unrealistic making the situation worse.

As I described above city employees DO have motivations to lose weight and live healthily , the problem is we do not have the machism to make the intrinsic motivation continue to grow (PS. we do not lack of extrinsic motivation for instance the peer pressure of overweight , the ad of losing weight , thin models,and so on..)

#2. Solution

1. Government can encourage people to exercise by devoloping an app that have the ability to record your daily steps ,daily calories consume and daily exercise and the system must have a reward system for good exercise and social context to promote the healthy life-style and the system must help people to make realistic mini-plans (Because bad plans REALLY demotivates people). To make the app popular , this app must have transitivity in other words the ability to promote. By using this App people can track their daily exercise and mini-plans and they can share with others on the social network. To make the motivation more intrinsic. I think we can add more fun and unexpected element to the app. If this app become popular i think it will be a great success.

2. Governments should engage a large community to motivate the good life style , We can establish a community especially for city employees health . By using this community we can create the machism to make the intrinsic motivation to lose weight more stronger and using the gamification technique to make the execrise process more like a game. And the community can produce a atmosphere of execrising to make people more likely to exercise.

By combining the two gamification projects aboves , i think , the obesity rate will reduce and the quality of life wiil be improved . This is beneficial both of people and government
