Gamification Design Document for ShareAll sharing Platform

1 ) Define business objectives

As the problem statement mentions, our main business objective is

1) making share use of products and services as common as individual purchases ,

2) creating vitural  currency for sharing

3) charging small transaction fee for making profit.

To make the bussiness objective work , we must have huge amount user to create a community-like structure for sharing, and to motivate them to share , and finally make the shareAll platform popular(as common as individual purchases),to meet these objectives above, we need a gamification described in next section.

2) Delinate target behavior

 Share : the system provide the standard PBL element to encourage people to share more, When people share something or successfully spend their Share , the system will provide some random rewards with high probabilty plus big rewards with low probablity to encourage people to share more , Besides the ShareAll system will provide share ranking board with special ranking algorithm to compare with your nearest neighbor .(helping people to set a reasonable goal to achieve). People will get badges when they share , and they can freely choose whether or not to show the badge.
 Organize :ShareAll system will award the person who is actively engaging in the system.  people can earn engage points in the system to LEVEL THEM UP, to achieve higher level of Sharing  Status. and the system allow user to recommand others to join , when the recommanded user level up, the recommander and the recommanded will both get benefit in the system (Free Share Point, Engage Point, Experience Point and etc.).
Be Social: Human are social animal, they don't want to be alone. So the system will recommand some share task to the lonely person and helping them to Be Social. (Using the most advanced machine learning algorithm), And to ordinary people ,the system will recommand some friends and share task that's most relevant to the user, helping them to build the community structure that ShareAll needed.
 
3) Describe your players
 
The ShareAll platform will attact a large amount of players from all over the world and ranging from wide aspect of society such as software engineers ,university student , workers , service providers, teachers , community holder , and person who has a urgent need. 
Demographics:  Age:18-60  Genders : 50% male 50% female    Come from: all over the world
Technology: People who can use the Internet or have an smartphone
Occupation: wide range covered all people who loves sharing 
Psychographics: The targeted group can be concluded in a following way, 1) Sharers  who liking sharing and benifited from sharing ,in network they have high out-degree and low in-degree 2) Needer who have strong and urgent need, They are located in the periphery of the network  3) Services provider using this platform to make profit,In network they have high centrality  4) Organizers who wants to organize sharing activity and do meaningful things.  In social network graph,they have high betweeness 5)  Socializer who connect lots of others to help them Share. They are hubs in the network.(Ideas from Social Network Analysis Course on Coursera:https://www.coursera.org/course/sna)

4) Devise activity loop
 
When a new user come into the system, the system will show a brief guide and give him few simple tasks to help him quickly be familiar with the system (The step of onboarding) , when user successfully  completed the task , the system will help him to set a realistic goal to LEVEL UP to earn more Shares. (The step of scaffolding) .
 
As user levels up , the system will provide him more challenging task for him ( To make a larger share or to help others who need a share). when he completed the system will give him immediate certain reward + uncertain big reward.  
 
To make the system more motivating , the ShareAll platform provide a visual representation of the share activity of yours and others, users can interact and comment on other's share, and could click the like button if they feel well. (Socializing)

5) Don't forget the fun

The system will make users engaged and provide intrinsic motivation by the following aspect:
Intersting System User Interface:  The system is designed by the most powerful designers studio , So user will feel at ease when using the ShareAll Platform.
Task Unlocking when level up: User can Unlock interesting Tasks by gaining Points and Leveling UP , when they level up, the system will provide a guide to the fresh Unlocked task.
Customization: Players can set their own sharing/wanting plans for themselves , and the system encourage players to make their plan public.
Social Engagement: Players can use the platform to communicate and making new friends , forming a stronger social bond.
Offline Meetup: Like Coursera meetup , user can organize a meetup and make sharing a lot more fun (Just like the TED movement)
6) Deploy appropiate tools
 
The system will be deployed into Cloud Platforms and have various type of Clients,it provides great convinences to users (To make people Share everywhere just like making purchease), and the system will use advanced crypto algorithm to ensure the safety of Share vitural currency, finally the system must interact with Paying platform like Paypal.(meeting the objective of making profit).
 
Here are some technical specification:
 Host Platform: Cloud Computer Platform for Server and Data Mining (Smart recommandation)
 Clients type: PC Client (Windows + Linux +Mac )  Mobile Client (iOS + Android) and Web Based application (works on any mordern browsers)
 Programming Language : Java,C++,Objective-C,Python,R,and Scala
 System Requirment for Client : Just an ordinary PC or ordinary mobile phone
 System Requirment for Server : A large Cloud-computing platform that could handle large number of users
